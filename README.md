Place these files into your home directory to use as local configuration files.

I use [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) as a vim bundle manager.
To install the vundle extras:

* add vundle to `~/.vim/bundle` (create it if it doesn't exist using `mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle`.)
* open vim and execute `:VundleInstall`
